# Words Per Minute App

This is a simple demo project that I wanted to create from scratch for a while, so here it is!
Written in HTML, CSS and Javascript, hosted locally.

By clicking the Enter key you start the game, and for each new word press Space.
Time is limited for 60 seconds, but you can change it to how much time you want.

Hope you like it :)
